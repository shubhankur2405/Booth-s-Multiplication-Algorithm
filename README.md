# Booth-s-Multiplication-Algorithm
This Project is done in C++. This Program is to build a simulator for the Booth’s 2’s complement number multiplier. In this practice, I used 16-bit operands for the multiplication, i.e., 16-bit multiplicand, 16-bit multiplier, and 32-bit product. The baseline simulation granurarity is 1-bit ALU component implemented by ALU_1_bit() function, and this program also includes ALU_16_BIT() function, 16-bit Booth’s multiplier implemented by booth() function,and the main driver. This Project can be run in Microsoft Visual Studio.
